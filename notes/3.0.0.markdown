New and improved!

This version contains some breaking changes, most notably around the `Async` effect which is removed (details in [#46](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/46)). 
Most improvements have been contributed by @edmundnoble and @benhutchison.

## Improvements

Breaking changes:

 * removed the `Async` effect and repackaged the syntax implicits for the various task/future effects. Now you 
   need to specify which `TaskEffect` (with implementations for `scalaz`, `monix`, `fs2`) or `FutureEffect` you want to use
  
 * added a method to update the read value of a Reader effect [#60](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/60). Three methods 
   are now available: 
     * `translateReader` to interpret a `Reader[A, ?]` effect into another `Reader[B, ?]` effect in the stack
     * `zoomReader` to replace a `Reader[A, ?]` effect with `Reader[B, ?]` in the same stack
     * `localReader` to modify the read value `A` in the `Reader[A, ?]` effect
    
 * similarly we have `translateEither`, `zoomEither` and `localEither` for the `EitherEffect`    
   
 * the implementation of effect coproducts (`Union` of effects) has been simplified with the introduction of 
   a `UnionTagged` class for better performance [#59](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/59)
   
 * it is possible to specify the target stack type with the `.runEither[U]` method [#50](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/50)

Non-breaking changes: 
   
 * implement `detach` in terms of `detachA` [#62](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/62)
 * promote `Rand` `Alternative` instance to `MonadPlus` [#63](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/63)
 * added a cookbook section on how to prepend effects "locally" [#64](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/64)
 * added `interceptNatM` to modify a given effect `T[_]` to `T[F[_]]` where `F` is a traversable monad [#57](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/57)
 * make `Unions` use `Vector` instead of `List` for asymptotic reasons [#58](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/58)
 * added the possibility to memoize `Safe` effects [#54](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/54)
 * updated the try-eff script [#51](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/pull/51)
