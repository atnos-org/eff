This version brings some breaking API changes for async effects in order to make them compatible with ScalaJS.

## Changes
   
 * `TimedFuture`, `TwitterTimedFuture`, scalaz `TimedTask`, fs2 `TimedTask` now use a `org.atnos.eff.Scheduler` instead of a `ScheduledExecutorService` to
 timeout computations
 
 * a `Scheduler` can be created from a `ScheduledExecutorService` with the `ExecutorServices.schedulerFromScheduledExecutorService` method for the JVM
 
 * a `Scheduler` can be created with the `org.atnos.eff.Schedulers.default` method for ScalaJS
 
 * the monix `Task` effect is now directly using the `monix.eval.Task` type instead of using a `TimedTask` type before. 
 The API stays the same except for stacks declarations which are now `Fx.fx1[Task]` instead of `Fx.fx1[TimedTask]`
