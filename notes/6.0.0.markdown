Dependencies upgrade!

The following dependencies were upgraded:

 * **cats**: now on `1.3.1`
 
No API change. 

 * **monix**: now on `3.0.0-RC1`
 
No API change. 
 
 * **cats-effect**: now on `1.0.0`

It turns out that it is not possible to provide a meaningful implementation of the cats-effect typeclasses like `Async` or `Effect` without
requiring that an `Eff[R, *]` stack is some sort of [`MonadUnliftIO`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unliftio) which restricts a lot the use cases for Eff. So rather than letting users go this path those instances have been removed.
