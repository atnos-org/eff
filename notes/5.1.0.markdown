### Improvements

This library upgrades `cats-effect` to `0.9.0` but also provides
 
  1. less restrictive implicit instances for `Async[Eff[R, *]]` when `R` contains `cats.effect.IO` or `io.monix.Task` effects
  
  2. 2 instances for `Effect[Eff[R, *]]` when `R` contains `cats.effect.IO` or `io.monix.Task` effects.
    Those instances can only be used if there is a way to transform `Eff[R, *]` into `cats.effect.IO` (respectively `io.monix.Task`)
    
Previously the `Async` instances were only define through the `Effect` instances in point 2, because `Effect` extends `Async`.
Now the `Async` instances are implicits and the `Effect` instances are explicit (no `implicit` keyword).
