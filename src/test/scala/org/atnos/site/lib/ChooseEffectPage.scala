The `Choose` effect is used for non-deterministic computations. With the `Choose` effect you can model computations which either:

  - return no result at all
  - choose between 2 different computations

`Choose` is actually a generalization of `List` where instead of "exploring" all the branches we might "cut" some of them.
That behaviour is controlled by the `Alternative[F]` instance you use when running `Choose`.

For example if we take `List` to run a similar example as before, we get the list of all the accepted pairs: ${snippet{
import org.atnos.eff._, all._, syntax.all._

type S = Fx.fx1[Choose]

// create all the possible pairs for a given list
// where the sum is greater than a value
def pairsBiggerThan[R :_choose](list: List[Int], n: Int): Eff[R, (Int, Int)] = for {
  a <- chooseFrom(list)
  b <- chooseFrom(list)
  found <- if (a + b > n) EffMonad[R].pure((a, b))
  else           zero
} yield found

import cats.instances.list._

pairsBiggerThan[S](List(1, 2, 3, 4), 5).runChoose.run
}.eval}
