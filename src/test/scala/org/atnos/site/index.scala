Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way.
This library is based on the "free-er" monad and an "open union" of effects described by
Oleg Kiselyov in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

You can learn more in the following sections, it is recommended to read them in order if you are new to `eff`:

 1. ${"installation and imports" ~ Installation}
 1. ${"your first effects" ~ Introduction}
 1. ${"standard effects in eff" ~ OutOfTheBox}: `Reader`, `Writer`, `Eval`, `State`,...
 1. ${"tutorial" ~ Tutorial}
 1. ${"create your own effects" ~ CreateEffects}
 1. ${"interpret and manipulate effect stacks" ~ TransformStack}
 1. ${"use Member implicits" ~ MemberImplicits }
 1. ${"use an applicative evaluation" ~ ApplicativeEvaluation}
 1. ${"tips and tricks" ~ Cookbook}
 1. ${"community resources" ~ CommunityResources}
