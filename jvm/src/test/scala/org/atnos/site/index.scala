Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way.
This library is based on the "free-er" monad and an "open union" of effects described by
Oleg Kiselyov in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

You can learn more in the following sections:

 - ${"installation and imports" ~ Installation}
 - ${"your first effects" ~ Introduction}
 - ${"standard effects in eff" ~ OutOfTheBox}: `Reader`, `Writer`, `Eval`, `State`,...
 - ${"create your own effects" ~/ CreateEffects}

 - ${"use Member implicits" ~/ MemberImplicits }
 - ${"use an applicative evaluation" ~ ApplicativeEvaluation}
