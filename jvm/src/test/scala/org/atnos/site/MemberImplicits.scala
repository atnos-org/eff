Type inference with the Eff monad can be a bit tricky to get right if we want to avoid type annotations. Here are some
tips to help you.

### Running effects with several type parameters

Some effects use 2 type variables, like `Reader` or `Writer`. If you want to use those effects in an effect stack you need
to make sure you have the following `scalac` option:
```scala
scalacOptions += "-Ypartial-unification"
```

### Use context bounds and type aliases

When creating effects you can always "require" a stack containing the right effects with the `MemberIn` typeclass:${snippet {
import org.atnos.eff._
import org.atnos.eff.all._

type StateInt[A] = State[Int, A]
type WriterString[A] = Writer[String, A]

// for creating state effects
def putAndTell[R](i: Int)(implicit s: StateInt |= R, w: WriterString |= R): Eff[R, Int] =
  for {
    // no type annotations needed!
    _ <- put(i)
    _ <- tell("stored " + i)
  } yield i
}}

You can even use context bounds to make the declaration of `putAndTell` more concise:${snippet{
import org.atnos.eff.all._

type _stateInt[R] = State[Int, ?] |= R
type _writerString[R] = Writer[String, ?] |= R

def putAndTell[R :_stateInt :_writerString](i: Int): Eff[R, Int] =
  for {
    _ <- put(i)
    _ <- tell("stored " + i)
  } yield i

}}

### Know your `Member` typeclasses

There are 3 different ways to declare that an effect is part of an effect stack with 3 typeclasses:

 Typeclass             | Alias    | Meaning                                            | When to use it
 -----------           | -----    | --------------------                               | --------------------------------
 `MemberIn[M, R]`      | `M |= R` | "`M` is part of `R`"                               | to create `M` effects in `R`
 `MemberInOut[M, R]`   | `M /= R` | "`M` is part of `R` and can be extracted from it"  | to intercept the effect `M` (see `Interpreter.scala`) and transform it while staying in the same stack. For example to `handleError` for an Error effect
 `Member[M, R]`        | `M <= R` | "`M` is part of `R`, can be extracted from it, and the resulting stack is `m.Out`" | to interpret the effect in terms of special values or other effects and remove the effect from the stack

### "Packing" member instances

Some function signatures can be repetitive when they always require the same list of effects:

   def foo1[R :_foo :_bar :_baz](i: Int): Eff[R, Int]
   def foo2[R :_foo :_bar :_baz](i: Int): Eff[R, Int]
   def foo3[R :_foo :_bar :_baz](i: Int): Eff[R, Int]

It is possible to "pack" them with the following `_effects` type definition:${snippet{

import org.atnos.eff.Members.{&:, &&:}

trait Foo[A]
trait Bar[A]
trait Baz[A]
trait Boo[A]

type _foo[R] = Foo |= R
type _bar[R] = Bar |= R
type _baz[R] = Baz |= R

// Note the last &&:, you can write instead: _foo[R] &: _bar[R] &: _baz[R] &: NoMember
type _effects[R] = _foo[R] &: _bar[R] &&: _baz[R]

def getFoo[R :_foo :_bar]: Eff[R, Int] = Eff.pure(1)
def getBar[R :_bar]: Eff[R, Int] = Eff.pure(1)
def getBaz[R :_baz]: Eff[R, Int] = Eff.pure(1)

object t {

  import org.atnos.eff.Members.extractMember

  def foo[R :_effects](i: Int): Eff[R, Int] =
    getFoo[R] >>
    getBar[R] >>
    getBaz[R]

}

// Then call foo with a concrete stack
type S = Fx.fx3[Foo, Bar, Baz]
type U = Fx.fx4[Foo, Bar, Baz, Boo]

t.foo[S](1)
t.foo[U](1)

}}

The implicit definition `extractMember` in the `Members` object will take care of "unpacking" the member instances where required.
Note that this implicit must *not* be in scope when calling the methods requiring the "packed" implicits otherwise it will
trigger a divergent implicit search.
