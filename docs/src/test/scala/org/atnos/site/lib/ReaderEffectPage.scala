The `Reader` effect is used to request values from an "environment". The main method is `ask` to get the current environment
(or "configuration" if you prefer to see it that way) and you can run an effect stack containing a `Reader` effect by
providing a value for the environment with the `runReader` method.

You can also inject a "local" reader into a "bigger" one:${snippet {

type R2[A] = Reader[Conf, A]

type S = Fx.fx2[R1, R2]

  p1 <- ask[R, Int]
} yield "the port is " + p1

getPort[S].translateReader((_: Conf).port).runReader(Conf("prod", 80)).run
