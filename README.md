Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way.
This library is based on the "free-er" monad and extensible effects described in
Oleg Kiselyov in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

## Installation

Eff is published for Scala 2.12, 2.13 and 3. `eff` core is available for the JVM, ScalaJS and scala-native. Sbt dependency:

```scala
// check maven badge above for latest version
libraryDependencies += "org.atnos" %% "eff" % "5.19.0"

// to write types like Reader[String, *]
addCompilerPlugin("org.typelevel" %% "kind-projector" % "0.13.2" cross CrossVersion.full)

// to get types like Reader[String, *] (with more than one type parameter) correctly inferred for scala 2.12.x
scalacOptions += "-Ypartial-unification"
```
