Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way. 
This library is based on the "free-er" monad and an "open union" of effects described in 
Oleg Kiselyov in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).
