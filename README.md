Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way.
This library is based on the "free-er" monad and extensible effects described in
Oleg Kiselyov in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

## Installation

Eff is published for Scala 2.12, 2.13 and 3. `eff` core is available for the JVM, ScalaJS and scala-native. Sbt dependency:

```scala
// check maven badge above for latest version
libraryDependencies += "org.atnos" %% "eff" % "6.0.0"

// to write types like Reader[String, *]
libraryDependencies ++= {
  if (scalaBinaryVersion.value == "3") {
    Nil
  } else {
    Seq(compilerPlugin("org.typelevel" %% "kind-projector" % "0.13.2" cross CrossVersion.full))
  }
}

scalacOptions ++= {
  if (scalaBinaryVersion.value == "3") {
    Seq("-Ykind-projector")
  } else {
    Nil
  }
}

// to get types like Reader[String, *] (with more than one type parameter) correctly inferred for scala 2.12.x
scalacOptions ++= {
  if (scalaBinaryVersion.value == "2.12") {
    Seq("-Ypartial-unification")
  } else {
    Nil
  }
}
```
