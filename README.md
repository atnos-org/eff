Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way.
This library is based on the "free-er" monad and extensible effects described in
Oleg Kiselyov in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

## Installation

You add `eff` as an sbt dependency:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.atnos" %% "eff" % "2.0.2"

// to write types like Reader[String, ?]
addCompilerPlugin("org.spire-math" %% "kind-projector" % "0.9.3")

// to get types like Reader[String, ?] (with more than one type parameter) correctly inferred for scala 2.11.8
addCompilerPlugin("com.milessabin" % "si2712fix-plugin_2.11.8" % "1.2.0")

// to get types like Reader[String, ?] (with more than one type parameter) correctly inferred for scala 2.12.x
scalacOptions += "-Ypartial-unification"

```
